# Weather App
This weather app was made by Darya Lapata, Maria Thomasson, Karoline Mann, Aschwin Siaila and Christoffer Torninger.
The project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. For this project we worked as a developer team using branches. 

# The problem

- merging and git commands between branches
- fetching and converting data into weekdays (ex: line 48 in Script.JS).
- setting icons for all the different weather-types (ex: line 66 in Script.JS)
- to figure out how to style using both classes and id's 

These problems were solved by searching on Stackoverflow and Google, asking class mates and code coaches. And good team work.
